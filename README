This dataset contains the raw MEG data accompanying the paper "The spatiotemporal neural dynamics of object recognition for natural images and line drawings" (Link to preprint: https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.08.12.503484v1). Please cite the above paper if you use this data.

The dataset includes:

MEG data for 9 runs for each subjects. Events files that contain the onsets, durations and trial types for each trial in the experiment (excluding catch trials).

For a full description of the paradigm and the employed procedures please see the manuscript.  

Results for the first-level analyses for this data can be found on OSF (https://osf.io/vsc6y/). Code for the analysis of the data can be found on Github (https://github.com/Singerjohannes/object_drawing_dynamics/).
